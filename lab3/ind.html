<h1>Zhuldyz Mamaeva</h1>
<p> My name is Zhuldyz, I am 18 years old and I am a student of the Faculty of Information Security at the International University of Information Technology.</p>
<p>Since school time I was fond of drawing and creativity in general. 
 I went to art school for a long time and graduated with honors in the 10th grade. But I entered on a specialty quite another direction.
</p>
<p>About myself, I will say that I am not extrovert and do not like to be in the spotlight. 
 But I very much appreciate time spent with close and native people. I really enjoy reading manga and watching anime. 
 And also recently I like to read books, especially classics in the genre of romance and drama. 
 I don't know yet what I will do after graduation, but I want to connect my future with graphic design.
</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I have been fascinated by reading lately. From what I have started reading, I can mention Arc de Triomphe, Chantaram, and The Book Thief. 
 And if you count for the sake of interest the arithmetic average of the pages of these books comes out :</p>
